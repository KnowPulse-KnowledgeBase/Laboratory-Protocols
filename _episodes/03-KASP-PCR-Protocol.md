## Notes before starting PCR:
* Because scoring is based on relative clustering, a minimum number of samples is recommended:
  -	No less than 8 for a well-developed, trusted assay
  -	No less than 16-24 for new, untested assays
  -	No less than 20-24 when trying to identify heterozygotes.  In this case one should include homozygous controls.
-	Always include a No Template Control (NTC)
-	Ensure your RT-PCR machine/Fluorometer is set to take fluorescent readings at the wavelengths recommended for VIC and FAM (see KASP Manual)

The following is the standard PCR program we use for KASP assays using **high-quality DNA** (CTAB, Qiagen kits).   We have added a few cycles to the program recommended by LGCBiosciences in the KASP Manual.
