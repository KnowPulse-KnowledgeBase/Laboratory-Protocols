## SAFETY INFORMATION
before you start, look up the MSDS sheets for all the chemicals used in this protocol.  Ensure you follow any recommendations/rules regarding wearing personal protective equipment,
emergency procedures, and clean-up/disposal procedures.  If you have any questions contact your supervisor or lab manager.

## The following protocol can be used to extract DNA from all pulse crops.

1. Collect a small coleoptile (2.5 cm) or leaf tissue (~100 mg) sample from the plant.  The tissue should be placed in a 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube and placed on ice.
2. Grind the plant tissue in the tube using a sterile micro-pestle.
3. Add 500 l of 65C 2X CTAB Extraction Buffer.  Mix thoroughly by inversion.  
4. Incubate tubes in a 65C water bath for 5-10 minutes.
5. Add 500 l of chloroform/isoamyl-alcohol (24:1).  Gently mix the 2 phases together.
6. Centrifuge the samples @ 13 000 rpm for 10 minutes.
7. Transfer the upper, aqueous phase to a new 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube.
8. Add 1/10 volume (~50 l or 2-3 small drops) of 65C 10% CTAB extraction buffer.  Mix thoroughly by inversion.
9. Incubate tubes in a 65C water bath for 5-10 minutes.
10. Add 500 l of chloroform/isoamyl-alcohol (24:1).  Gently mix the 2 phases together.
11. Centrifuge the samples @ 13 000 rpm for 10 minutes.
12. Transfer the upper, aqueous phase to a new 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube.
13. Add 800 l of cold 95% ethanol.  Mix thoroughly and place @ -20C 30 minutes.
14. Centrifuge the samples @ 13 000 rpm for 10 minutes.
15. Decant the ethanol and add 500 l of cold 70% ethanol.  Mix thoroughly and place @ -20C for 5-15 minutes
16. Centrifuge the samples @ 13 000 rpm for 10 minutes.
17. Pipette off the ethanol and let tubes air dry. Alternatively a speed-vac can be used.
18. Resuspend DNA in 100 l of sterile H2O.
19. Add 1 U+00B5 (181)l of 10 mg/mL RNAse A.  

## Notes:
-	Samples can be left O/N after adding the ethanol in step 13 or 15.
-	While samples are incubating in the 65C H2O bath, they should periodically be mixed by inversion.
-	Can expect an average product of ~200-400 ng/l (x100l) = 20 – 40 g
-	Have gotten over 1000 ng/l = 100 g.
-	Final tubes should be labeled with complete name (for varieties) or population and line number (not entry number).

## 2 X CTAB

						/100mL	/500mL	/1L
ddH2O			(mL)		86		430		860
CTAB			(g)		2		10		20		
Polyvinylpyrrolidone 	(g)		1		5		10

0.5M EDTA 8.0		(mL)		4		20		40
NaCl (FW 58.44g)	(g)		8.2		40.9		81.8

Slowly add components in order and allow each to dissolve.
Use mild heat to help facilitate dissolving – may take a couple hours.
Autoclave.
(CTAB – Cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium-bromide)


## 10% CTAB
						/100mL	/500mL
ddH2O			(mL)		100		500
CTAB			(g)		10		50

Dissolve CTAB before the salt.
Use mild heat to help dissolve – may take a couple hours.
Autoclave.


## 0.5M EDTA pH 8.0

Add 186.1 g of Disodium-ethylenediamine-tetra-acetate to 800mL H2O.
pH to 8.0, using NaOH pellets, and adjust final volume to 1 L.
Autoclave.


## 1M Tris-HCl pH 8.0

Add 121.1 g of Tris base in 800mL H2O.
pH to 8.0, using HCl, and adjust final volume to 1 L.
Autoclave.
